## :Cym: Intro
Hi, I’m @lessthanstoic a Data Engineer with a short background in professional development, 
but a long background in application of computational skills and solving technical challenges 
in the field of Life Sciences.

I invite you take a look around, take in the repos, view the projects, breath in the code.
Hopefully you will enjoy the experience and maybe even want to collaborate on something cool.
